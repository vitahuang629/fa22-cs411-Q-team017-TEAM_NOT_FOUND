## Project Summary

Our project is an online order system that lets users purchase merchandise from local Farmer's Market. Meanwhile, the farmers can post their products on the system. More specifically, the customers can browse and buy the products, and the farmers can post their products. Unlike other supermarkets such as Walmart and Costco, our system focuses on a vertical market. It only offers agricultural products which are produced directly from the farms. We notice that people love to buy things from Farmer's Market, but there are no existing systems to help them purchase those products online. This platform can, on the one hand, be a convenient way for the customers and, on the other hand, be a way for the farmers to promote their products. 

Our project is implemented mainly using MySQL, a relational database at the technical level. The front-end uses HTML+CSS+JavaScript, and the back-end primarily uses Java and SpringBoot frameworks. Our project involves many inter-table interactions, such as the data need to be manipulated from the shopping cart table and the product table when creating an order, and a trigger is used to determine whether the product is in stock or not.
